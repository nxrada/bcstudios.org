                <h2>about us,</h2>
                <p>blue cow studios ltd. is a collection of multidisciplinary designers focused on fostering an irreverent
                    and immersive gaming experience for the player. our mission is to create multimedia works of art
                    through combining stunning visual landscapes with solid gameplay mechanics. Our vision is a world
                    where both gamers and developers share a passion for beauty and aesthetics.</p>
                <p>blue cow studios ltd. was founded on a facetime call in late december 2022, by two childhood friends,
                    nick kammerer and luke sharkey, who realized the potential of a project synthesizing their unique
                    expertise in two overlapping domains of design.</p>
                <p>nick kammerer, chief executive officer and lead software engineer, is currently on his way to earning
                    a bachelor's of science in informatics/software development from the state university of new york at
                    albany. despite the phonetic resemblance of his last name, he did not invent any devices for recording
                    visual images in the form of photographs, film, or video signals.</p>
                <p>luke sharkey, chief marketing officer and graphics designer, is currently on his way to earning a
                    bachelor's of arts in industrial design from rochester institute of technology. despite the phonetic
                    resemblance of his last name, he has no relationship to any long-bodied chiefly marine fish with a
                    cartilaginous skeleton, a prominent dorsal fin, and toothlike scales.</p>
                <p>blue cow studios is currently in the early stages of formation, with our first release planned sometime
                    during the final quarter of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023.</p>
